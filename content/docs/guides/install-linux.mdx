## Install from Flathub

The easiest way to get Enso on your Linux-based operating system is to install it from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/app.enso_browser.enso). You can also use app stores that supports Flatpak, like GNOME Software, KDE Discover, Cosmic Store and more.

Your profile for Flatpak version of Enso will be available in `~/.var/app/app.enso_browser.enso/enso/`. You can go to `about:profiles` to check your profile name, then open the directory manually using your file manager app with the prefix path above.

## Install from Tarball Scripts

Enso provides install scripts that will install the browser directly to your home directory. Run this command from your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/enso-browser/updates-server/raw/refs/heads/main/install.sh | $SHELL
```

Enso will be installed in `~/.tarball-installations/enso`.

You can also use the script below to install Twilight version of Enso, which built freshly every night and contained the latest changes. You can use Enso Twilight to try new features, [catch bugs and report them](https://github.com/enso-browser/desktop/issues) before it arrived on regular Beta builds!

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/enso-browser/updates-server/raw/refs/heads/main/install-twilight.sh | $SHELL
```

Enso Twilight will be installed in `~/.tarball-installations/enso-twilight`.

Your profile for tarball version of Enso and Enso Twilight will be available in `~/.enso/`. Check `about:profiles` to see your profile name and access the directory directly.

## Download Directly

You can also download Enso tarball and AppImage files directly, as well as formats for other OS in [latest Enso Github Releases](https://github.com/enso-browser/desktop/releases/tag/latest) page.
